\section{Introduction}

In this note we give an affirmative answer to the question asked by Dmitry Burago; 
the same question was also stated in \cite{AH-PSV}, \cite{pach} and \cite{BKZ}.
Namely, we prove the following.

\begin{thm}{Main theorem}\label{thm:main}
The total curvature of a minimizing geodesic
on a convex surface in $\RR^3$ can not exceed $1000^{1000}$.
\end{thm}

The value $2\cdot\pi$ is the optimal bound for the analogous problem in the plane.
The total curvature
of minimizing geodesic on a convex surface in $\RR^3$
can exceed $2\cdot\pi$
and the optimal bound 
is expected to be slightly bigger than $2\cdot\pi$.
The former example was constructed by B{\'a}r{\'a}ny,
Kuperberg, 
and Zamfirescu in \cite{BKZ}.
Let us list other related results.

\begin{itemize}
\item In \cite{liberman}, Liberman gives a bound on the total curvature of short geodesic in terms of the ratio diameter and inradius of $K$.
In the proof he use an analog of Lemma \ref{lem:liberman} discussed below.

\item In \cite{usov}, 
Usov gives the optimal bound for the total curvature of geodesics on the graphs of $\ell$-Lipscitz convex function. 
Namely, he proves that if $f\:\RR^2\to\RR$ is $\ell$-Lipschitz and convex then any 
geodesic in its graph 
\[\Gamma_f=\set{(x,y,z)\in \RR^3}{z=f(x,y)}\] 
has total curvature at most $2\cdot \ell$.
An amusing generalization of Usov's result is given by Berg in \cite{berg}.
\item In \cite{pogorelov}, Pogorelov conjectured %???maybe before
that the spherical image of geodesic on convex surface has to be rectifiable.
It is easy to see that the length of spherical image of geodesic can not be smaller than its total curvature, 
so this conjecture (if it would be true) 
would be stronger than Liberman's theorem.
Counterexamples were found indepenently by Milka in \cite{milka}, 
Usov in \cite{usov-conj-pog} 
and partly rediscovered by Pach in \cite{pach}.
\item In \cite{BKZ},
B{\'a}r{\'a}ny,
Kuperberg, 
and Zamfirescu 
have constructed a corkscrew minimizing geodesic on a closed convex surface;
that is a minimizing geodesic which twists around given line arbitrary many times.
They also rediscovered the results of Liberman and Usov mentioned above.
\end{itemize}


\section{Preliminaries}

\parbf{Semicontinuity of total curvature.}
Recall that the \emph{total curvature} of a curve $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \RR^3$ 
(briefly $\tc\gamma$)
is defined as supremum of sum of exterior angles 
for the polygonal lines inscribed in $\gamma$.

Note that for a polygonal line $\sigma$, 
its total curvature coinside with the sum of its exterior angles.

If $\gamma$ is a smooth curve with unit-speed parametrization, 
then 
\[\tc\gamma=\int\limits_0^\ell \kappa(t)\cdot dt,\]
where $\kappa(t)=|\ddot\gamma(t)|$ is the curvature of $\gamma$ at $t$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:semicontinuity}
Assume $\gamma_n\:\II\to\RR^3$ is a sequence of curves  converging pointwise to a curve $\gamma_\infty\:\II\to\RR^3$.
Then 
\[\liminf_{n\to\infty}\tc\gamma_n\ge \tc\gamma_\infty.\]
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Fix a polygonal line $\sigma_\infty$ inscribed in $\gamma_\infty$.
Let $\gamma_\infty(t_0),\dots,\gamma_\infty(t_k)$
for $t_0<\dots<t_k$
be the vertices of $\sigma_\infty$.
Consider the polygonal lines $\sigma_n$ inscribed in $\gamma_n$ with the vertices 
$\gamma_n(t_0),\dots,\gamma_n(t_k)$.
Note that 
\[\tc\sigma_n\to\tc\sigma_\infty.\]
By the definition of total curvature 
\[\tc\sigma_n\le\tc\gamma_n.\]
The statement follows since the broken line $\sigma_\infty$ can be chosen in such a way that 
$\tc\sigma_\infty$ is arbitrary close to $\tc\gamma_\infty$.
\qeds

\parbf{Convergence.}
Given a closed set $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$,
denote by $\dist_\Sigma$ the distance function from $\Sigma$;
that is 
\[\dist_\Sigma(x)=\inf\set{|x-y|}{y\in\Sigma}.\]

We say that a sequence of closed sets $\Sigma_n\subset \RR^3$
converges to the closed set $\Sigma_\infty\subset \RR^3$ 
if for any $x\in\RR^3$,
we have
$\dist_{\Sigma_n}(x)\to\dist_{\Sigma_\infty}(x)$ as $n\to\infty$.


\parbf{Convex surfaces.}
By \emph{convex surface} $\Sigma$ in the Euclidean 3-space $\RR^3$ we understand the boundary of a closed convex set $K$ with nonempty interior.
If $K$ is compact we say that the $\Sigma$ is \emph{closed}.

Assume $\Sigma$ is smooth.
If at every point both of its principle curvatures are positive, we say that $\Sigma$ is \emph{strongly convex}. 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:convegence}
Assume $\Sigma_n$ be a sequence of convex surfaces which converge to a convex surface $\Sigma_\infty$.
Then for any minimizing geodesic $\gamma_\infty$ in $\Sigma_\infty$ there is a sequence of minimizing geodesics $\gamma_n$ in $\Sigma_n$ which pointwise converge to $\gamma_\infty$ as $n\to \infty$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume $\gamma_\infty\:[0,\ell]\to\Sigma_\infty$ is parametrized by its arc length.

Fix a subinterval $[a,b]\subset (0,\ell)$.
Set $p_\infty=\gamma_\infty(a)$ and $q_\infty=\gamma_\infty(b)$.
Let $p_n,q_n\zz\in\Sigma_n$ be a two sequences of points which converge to $p_\infty$ and $q_\infty$ 
correspondingly.

Denote by $\gamma_n$ a minimizing geodesic from $p_n$ to $q_n$ in $\Sigma_n$.
Note that $\gamma_n$ converges to $\gamma_\infty|_{[a,b]}$
as $n\to\infty$.

Taking the subinterval  $[a,b]$ closer and closer to $[0,\ell]$
and applying diagonal procedure, we get the result.

\section{Liberman's lemma.}

In this section we give a slight generalization 
of the construction given by Liberman in \cite{liberman}.

\parbf{Development.}
Let $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to\RR^3$ be a curve parametrized by length
and a point $p$ does not lie on $\gamma$.

Assume  $\tilde\gamma_p\:[0,\ell]\to\RR^2$ is a plane curve parametrized by length
and $\tilde p$ is a point in the plane such that 
\[|\tilde p-\tilde\gamma(t)|=|\tilde p-\tilde\gamma(t)|\]
for any $t\in[0,\ell]$ and the direction from $\tilde p$ to $\tilde \gamma(t)$ changes counterclockwise. 
Then $\tilde\gamma_p$ is called \emph{development} of $\gamma$ with respect to $p$.

\begin{center}
\begin{lpic}[t(3 mm),b(6 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/convex-concave(1)}
\lbl[l]{23,13;$\tilde\gamma_p(a)$}
\lbl[r]{0,22;$\tilde\gamma_p(b)$}
\lbl[r]{0,3;$\tilde p$}
\lbl[l]{73,13;$\tilde\gamma_p(a)$}
\lbl[r]{50,22;$\tilde\gamma_p(b)$}
\lbl[r]{50,3;$\tilde p$}
\lbl[t]{10,-1;Convex development.}
\lbl[t]{60,-1;Concave development.}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}

We say that the development $\tilde\gamma_p$ is convex (concave) in the interval $[a,b]$
if the lune bounded by arc $\tilde\gamma_p|_{[a,b]}$
and the segment $[\tilde\gamma_p(a)\tilde\gamma_p(b)]$
is convex and lies on with $\tilde p$ on the opposite side 
from the line through $\tilde\gamma_p(a)$ and $\tilde\gamma_p(b))$ 
(correspondingly the same side from this line).

We say that $\tilde\gamma_p$ is locally convex (concave) in the interval $[a,b]$
if any point $x\in [a,b]$ admits a closed neighborhood $[a',b']$ in $[a,b]$
such that $\tilde\gamma_p$ is convex (correspondingly concave) in the interval $[a',b']$.

If we pass to the limit of this construction as $p$ moves to infinity along a half-line in the derection of a unit vector $\bm{u}$ then the limit curve is called development of $\gamma$ in direction $\bm{u}$ and denoted as $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}$.

We can define the development $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}$ directly:
(1) the development $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}\:[0,\ell]\to \R^2$
is parametrized by length,
(2) for a fixed unit vector $\tilde{\bm{u}}\in\RR^2$,
we have
\[\langle \tilde{\bm{u}},\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}(t)\rangle
=
\langle  \bm{u},\gamma(t)\rangle\]
for any $t\in [0,\ell]$
and 
(3) the projection of $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}(t)$ to the line normal to $\tilde{\bm{u}}$
is monotonic in $t$.

We can assume that $\tilde{\bm{u}}$ is the vertical vector in the coordinate plane.
We say that $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}$ is concave (convex) in the interval $[a,b]$ 
if the lune bounded by arc $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}|_{[a,b]}$
and the segment $[\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}(a)\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}(b)]$
is convex and lies above (correspondingly below) the line segment $[\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}(a)\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}(b)]$.
 
\parbf{Dark and light sides.}
Let $\Sigma\subset\RR^3$ be a convex surface 
and $z\notin\Sigma$ and $p\in\Sigma$.

We say that $p$ lies on the dark (light) side of $\Sigma$ with from $z$ 
if non of the points $p+t\cdot(p-z)$ lie inside of $\Sigma$ for $t>0$ (correspondingly for $t<0$).
The intersection of dark and light side is called horizon of $z$;
it is denoted by $\omega_z$.

Note that if $z$ lies inside $\Sigma$ then all the points on $\Sigma$ lies on dark side from $z$ and its horizon is empty.

If $\Sigma$ is smooth we can define the outer normal vector $\nu_p$ to $\Sigma$ at $p$.
In this case $p$ lies on dark (light) side of $\Sigma$ from $z$
if and only if $\langle p-z,\nu_p\rangle\ge 0$
(correspondingly for $\langle p-z,\nu_p\rangle\le 0$).
If in addition $\Sigma$ is closed and strongly convex then the horizon is empty or it is formed by a closed smooth curve.

We could also define light/dark sides and horizon in the limit case,
as $p$ escapes to infinity along a half-line in derection $\bm{u}$.
Let us also define it derectly,
we say that a point $p\in\Sigma$ lies on dark (light) side for the unit vector $\bm{u}$ if non of the points $p+\bm{u}\cdot t$ lie inside of $\Sigma$ for $t>0$, (correspondingly $t<0$).
As before the intersection of light and dark side is called horizon of $\bm{u}$ and it is denoted as $\omega_{\bm{u}}$.

In the smooth case the later means that $\langle \nu_p,\bm{u}\rangle\ge 0$ (correspondingly $\langle \nu_p,\bm{u}\rangle\le 0$).
If in addition $\Sigma$ is closed strongly convex then $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ is a closed smooth curve.

\begin{thm}{Liberman's Lemma}\label{lem:liberman}
Assume $\gamma$ be a geodesic on the convex surface $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$.
Then for any point $z\notin\Sigma$ the development $\tilde\gamma_z$ is locally convex (locally concave) if $\gamma$ lies on dark (correspondingly light) side of $\Sigma$ from $z$.

Similarly for any unit vector $\bm{u}$,
the development $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}$ is locally convex (locally concave) if $\gamma$ lies on dark (correspondingly light) side of $\Sigma$ for $\bm{u}$.

\end{thm}

Note that for any space curve $\gamma$ and any unit vector $\bm{u}$
we have 
\[\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}\le\tc\gamma.\]
On the other hand total curvature of few developments gives an estimate 
for the total curvature of the original curve.
For example, if $\bm{i},\bm{j},\bm{k}$ is the orthonormal basis then
\[\tc\gamma
\le
\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{i}}+\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{j}}+\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{k}}.\]

If $\gamma$ lies on one dark or light side for direction $\bm{u}$
then by Liberman's lemma we get 
\[\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}\le \pi.\]
It follows that if $\gamma$ cross the horisons $\omega_{\bm{i}}$, $\omega_{\bm{j}}$ and $\omega_{\bm{k}}$
at most $N$ times then 
\begin{align*}
\tc\gamma
&\le
\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{i}}
+\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{j}}
+\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{k}}
\le
\\
&\le(N+1)\cdot \pi.
\end{align*}
Therefore if $\gamma$ violetes Main Theorem then it has to cross the  horisons $\omega_{\bm{i}}$, $\omega_{\bm{j}}$ and $\omega_{\bm{k}}$ huge number of times.

\section{Curvature of development}

Let $\Sigma\subset\RR^3$
be a strongly convex smooth surface
and $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ be a unit-speed geodesic.
Assume that for some unit vector $\bm{u}$,
the geodesic $\gamma$ cross the horizon $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ transversely at 
$t_0<\dots <t_k$.
Set $\alpha_i=\measuredangle(\dot\gamma(t_i),\bm{u})-\tfrac\pi2$ for each $i$.
Note that $|\alpha_i|\le\tfrac\pi2$.


Further note that that 
\[[\dot\gamma(t_i),\bm{u}]=\pm\cos\alpha_i\cdot\nu_{\gamma(t_i)},
\]
where $[{*},{*}]$ denotes vector product 
and $\nu_p$ is the outer normal vector to $\Sigma$ at the point $p\in\Sigma$.
Therefore we can choose signs $s_i=\pm1$
such that 
\[[\dot\gamma(t_i),\bm{u}]=s_i\cdot\cos\alpha_i\cdot\nu_{\gamma(t_i)}
\]
for each $i$.

The values $t_i$, $\alpha_i$ and $s_i$ 
will be called correspondingly \emph{meeting moments},\emph{meeting angles} and \emph{meeting signs}
of the geodesic $\gamma$ with the horizon $\omega_{\bm{u}}$.

%\lbl[lb]{8,17;{\small $\alpha_0$}}
%\lbl[lb]{34,13;{\small $\alpha_1$}}
%\end{lpic}
%\end{center}

Let us introduce new notation
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}\gamma\df\tc\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}.\]
From Liberman's lemma \ref{lem:liberman},
we get the following.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:liberman}
Let $\Sigma\subset\RR^3$
be a strongly convex smooth surface
and $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ be a unit-speed geodesic.
Assume that for some unit vector $\bm{u}$,
the $\gamma$ cross the horizon $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ transversely
and 
$t_0<\dots <t_k$ be its meeting moments 
and $\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_k$ be its meeting angles with the horizon $\omega_{\bm{u}}$.
Then
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}\gamma
\le 3\cdot\pi
+
2\cdot\left|\alpha_0-\alpha_1
+\dots +(-1)^k\cdot\alpha_k\right|
\]

\end{thm}

Further, in order to find the needed estimate the total curvature
of geodesic we will get an upper bound for
\[\left|\alpha_0-\alpha_1
+\dots +(-1)^k\cdot\alpha_k\right|.\]
Finding  such an upper bound is the most important ingredient in the proof of the Main Theorem.


\parit{Proof.}
By Liberman's lemma,
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[t_{i-1},t_i]})=\pm(\alpha_{i-1}-\alpha_i)\]
where the sign is ``$+$'' 
if the tongue $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ lies on the dark side 
and ``$-$'' if it lies on the light side from $u$.
Summing all this up we get
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[t_1,t_{k}]})
=
\left|\alpha_0
-2\cdot\alpha_1
+\dots+(-1)^{k-1}\cdot2\cdot\alpha_{k-1}+(-1)^k\cdot\alpha_k\right|.\]
By Liberman's lemma we also have
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[0,t_1]}),\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[t_k,\ell]})\le \pi \]
Since $\alpha_0,\alpha_k\le\tfrac\pi2$, the statement follows.
\qeds 

If $\Sigma$ is a surface in $\RR^3$ and $p\in\Sigma$
we denote by $K_p$ the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ at $p$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{37 mm}

\lbl[t]{1,11;{\tiny $\gamma(t_i)$}}
\lbl[t]{15,11;{\tiny $\gamma(t_i)$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
Assume $a,b$ be the meeting moments of minimizing geodesic $\gamma$ with $\omega_{\bm{u}}$
The arc $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ will be called \emph{$\omega_{\bm{u}}$-tongue}
if there is an immersed disc 
$\iota\:\DD\looparrowright\Sigma$ 
such that the closed curve $\iota|_{\partial D}$ is formed by joint of the arc $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ and an arc of $\omega_{\bm{u}}$.
In this case the immersion $\iota$ is called the \emph{disc of the tongue}.

\begin{thm}{Tongue Lemma}
Let $\bm{u}$ be a unit vector,
$\gamma\:[a,b]\to\Sigma$ 
be a minimizing geodesic on the strongly convex surface $\Sigma\subset\RR^3$ which is a $\omega_{\bm{u}}$-tongue.
and 
$\iota\:\DD\looparrowright\Sigma$
is its disc.

Then 
\[\int\limits_{\DD} K_{\iota(x)}\cdot d_{\iota(x)}\area_\Sigma\] takes one of the value
\[\alpha-\beta,
\  -\alpha+\beta,
\ \pi-\alpha-\beta,
 \pi+\alpha+\beta \pmod{2\cdot\pi}
\]
if the pair of meeting signs $(s_a,s_b)$ 
at $a$ and $b$ takes value
\[(+1,+1),\ (-1,-1),\ (+1,-1),\ (-1,+1)\] 
correspondingly.

In particular 
\[\bigl|\alpha-\beta\bigr|
\le
\int\limits_{\DD} K_{\iota(x)}\cdot d_{\iota(x)}\area_\Sigma.
\eqlbl{eq:key2}\]
If in addition $\iota(\DD)$ lies  completely in the dark or light side for $\bm{u}$ then
\[\tc_{}\gamma
\le 
\int\limits_{\iota(\DD)} K_p\cdot d_p\area_\Sigma.\eqlbl{eq:key3}\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Since $\gamma$ is a geodesic, 
the parallel translation along $\gamma$ maps $\dot\gamma(a)$ to $\dot\gamma(b)$.

Note also that $\bm{u}$ belongs to the tangent plane to $\Sigma$ at any point on the horizon $\omega_{\bm{u}}$;
in particular the $\bm{u}$ extends to a parallel tangent vector field on $\omega_{\bm{u}}$.

It follows that parallel translation along $\iota|_{\partial\DD}$ 
rotates the tangent plane by angle 
\[s_a\cdot(\tfrac\pi2+\alpha)-s_b\cdot(\tfrac\pi2+\beta)\]
To prove the main statement of the lemma,
it remains to apply Gauss--Bonnet formula.

Denote by $R$ the right hand side in \ref{eq:key2}.
Note that $R\ge 0$ 
and $|\alpha|,|\beta|\le \tfrac\pi2$.
From the main statement of the lemma it follows then that the minimal possible value for $R$ is $\bigl||\alpha|-|\beta|\bigr|$.

To prove \ref{eq:key3}, note that 
in this case $\iota$ is an embedding.
Further note that the spherical image of the dark side of $\Sigma$ is hemisphere.
Therefore $2\cdot\pi$ is the integral of Gauss curvature along the dark side.
It follows that
\[\int\limits_{\DD} K_{\iota(x)}\cdot d_{\iota(x)}\area_\Sigma
=
\int\limits_{\iota(\DD)} K_p\cdot d_p\area_\Sigma
<2\cdot\pi.\]
Whence the statement follows from Liberman's lemma.
\qeds

\parbf{Snakes and spirals.}
Let us show how to apply the Tongue Lemma in the simplest case
and explain the difficulty of the general case.

Assume $\gamma$ cross the horizon $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ as shown on the picture.
\begin{center}
\begin{lpic}[t(2 mm),b(1 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/horizon-geodesic(1)}
\lbl[t]{5,5.5;$\gamma(0)$}
\lbl[bl]{16,14;$\gamma(t_0)$}
\lbl[b]{40.5,18,3;$\dots$}
\lbl[br]{66,16.5;$\gamma(t_k)$}
\lbl[t]{73,12;$\gamma(\ell)$}
\lbl[tl]{29,4;$\omega_{\bm{u}}$}
\lbl[]{24.5,8;$\Omega_1$}
\lbl[]{56,10;$\Omega_k$}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}
That is, $t_0<\dots<t_k$ are the $\bm{u}$-crossing moments 
and the points $\gamma(t_0),\dots,\gamma(t_k)$ appear along $\omega_{\bm{u}}$
in the same order.

Note that each arc $\gamma|_{[t_{n-1},t_n]}$ is a $\bm{u}$-tongue.
In this case we can chose nonoverlaping embedded discs $\Omega_1,\dots,\Omega_k$ for these tongues which $\gamma$ cuts from light and dark side alternatively.

Set
\[K(\Omega)\df\int\limits_\Omega K_p\cdot d_p\area.\]
Then by Tongue lemma,
\begin{align*}
\tc_{\bm{u}}\gamma
&=\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[0,t_0]})
+\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[t_0,t_1]})+\dots
\\
&\ \ \ \ \dots+\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[t_{k-1},t_k]})+\tc_{\bm{u}}(\gamma|_{[t_k,\ell]})\le
\\
&\le \pi+K(\Omega_1)+\dots+K(\Omega_k)+\pi\le
\\
&\le 6\cdot\pi.
\end{align*}

The last inequality holds since  by Gauss--Bonnet,
$$K(\Omega_1)+\dots+K(\Omega_k)\le K(\Sigma)\le4\cdot\pi.\eqlbl{eq:4pi}$$

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{35 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-5 mm),b(0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/spiral(1)}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}


If the $\gamma$ cross $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ 
in a different order, 
say as the spiral shown on the picture then the idea above is not directly applicable.
Indeed, no matter how we choose the discs $\Omega_i$ for the tongues they will always overlap
and therefore inequality \ref{eq:4pi} may not hold.


\section{Length and diameter}

Let $\eps>0$.
A curve $\gamma\:[a,b]\to\RR^3$ will be called $\eps$-straight
if 
\[(1-\eps)\cdot\length \gamma\le |\gamma(b)-\gamma(a)|\]

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:eps-straight}
Assume $\eps>0$ 
and $n$ is a positive integer such that
$n\cdot\eps>2$.
Then any 
in any minimizing geodesic
on a convex surface $\Sigma$ in $\RR^3$
can be sudivided into  $\eps$-straight arcs $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\theta\in(0,\pi)$
be such that 
\[1-\cos\theta=\eps.\]

Assume two points $p$ and $q$ lie on the convex surface $\Sigma$.
Denote by $\nu_p$ and $\nu_q$ the outer normal vectors at $p$ and $q$ correspondingly.
Note that any minimizing geodesic geodesic from $p$ to $q$ on $\Sigma$
is $\eps$-straight if 
\[\measuredangle(\nu_p,\nu_q)\le 2\cdot\theta.\]

Let $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ be a minimizing geodesic parametrized by its length.

Assume $\gamma_{[t,\ell]}$ is not $\eps$-straigt.
Set $t'$ to be the maximal value in $[t,\ell)$ such that the  interval $[t,t']$ is $\eps$-straight.
Consider a sequence $0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_n<\ell$
such that $t_{i+1}=t_i'$ for each $i$.
Denote by $\nu_i$ the outer unit normal vector to $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(t_i)$. 
From above we get
\[\measuredangle(\nu_i,\nu_j)\ge2\cdot\theta\] for all $i$ and $j$.
In other words, the open balls $\mathrm{B}_\theta(\nu_i)$ do not overlap 
in $\SS^2$.

It remains to note that 
\[\area[\mathrm{B}_\theta(\nu_i)] =2\cdot\pi\cdot\eps
 \ \ \text{and}\ \ 
 \area\SS^2=4\cdot\pi.
\]
Hence the result follows.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Assume $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ is a unit-speed minimizing geodeisic on the convex surface $\Sigma$ in $\RR^3$.
Then $\diam \gamma\ge \tfrac\ell{10}$.
\end{thm}


\section{An arc in almost constant direction}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:almost-const}
For any $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that the following holds.

If $\gamma\:[a,b]\to\Sigma$ is a minimizing geodeisc 
on a smooth strongly convex surface $\Sigma$ in $\RR^3$
then there is an interval $[a',b']\subset[a,b]$
such that 
\[\tc(\gamma|_{[a',b']})>\delta\cdot\tc\gamma.\]
and 
\[\measuredangle(\dot\gamma(t),\bm{u})<\eps\] 
for a fixed unit vector $\bm{u}$
and any $t\in[a,b]$.

Moreover, if $\eps=\tfrac1{10}$ then one can assume $\delta=\tfrac1{100^{100}}$.
\end{thm}

In the proof we will need the following two lemmas.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:almost-const-angles}
For any $\eps$ there is $\delta>0$ such that the following holds.

Assume $\gamma$ is a curve,
$\bm{v}_1$ and $\bm{v}_2$  be two vectors in $\RR^3$
and $0\le\alpha_1,\alpha_2\le\pi$ be such that
such that 
\begin{align*}
\eps
&<\measuredangle(\bm{v}_1,\bm{v}_2)<\pi-\eps
\\
\alpha_i-\delta
&<\measuredangle(\bm{v}_i,\dot\gamma(t))< \alpha_i+\delta
\end{align*}
then there is a vector $\bm{u}$ such that
$\measuredangle(\bm{u},\dot\gamma(t))<\eps$.

Moreover if $\eps<\tfrac1{10}$ 
then one can take $\delta=\eps^{10}$.
\end{thm}

The proof of the lemma above 
is straightforward computation;
we omit it.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:almost-const}
For any $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$
such that the following holds.

Let $\gamma\:[a,b]\to\Sigma$ 
be an $\delta$-straight minimizing geodesic 
on a smooth strongly convex surface $\Sigma$ in $\RR^3$.
Set $\bm{v}_\gamma=\gamma(b)-\gamma(a)$.
Then there in a subinterval $[a',b']$ in $[a,b]$
such that 
\[\tc(\gamma|_{[a',b']})\ge\delta\cdot\tc\gamma.\]
and 
\[\alpha-\eps
\le
\measuredangle(\dot\gamma(t),\bm{v}_\gamma)
\le\alpha+\eps\] 
for some fixed $\alpha$
and
any $t\in[a',b']$.

Moreover if $\eps<\tfrac1{10}$ one can take $\delta=\eps^{10}$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality we can assume that
$a=0$, $b=2$ and 
\[\tc(\gamma|_{[1,2]})
\ge
\tfrac12\cdot\tc\gamma.\]

Set $p=\gamma(0)$.
Let $\theta\in(0,\pi)$ be such that $1-\cos\theta=\delta$.
Note that 
$$\measuredangle(\bm{v}_\gamma,\gamma(t)-p)
\le
\measuredangle(\tilde\gamma_p(1)-\tilde p,\tilde\gamma_p(2)-\tilde p)
<
\theta
\eqlbl{eq:angle1}$$
for any $t\ge 1$.

By Liberman's lemma 
\[\tc_p(\gamma|_{[1,2]})< \pi+\theta.\]
Assume $N=\lceil\tfrac\pi\theta+1\rceil$.
Then we can subdivide $\gamma|_{[1,2]}$ into $N$ arcs 
such that $\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\dots,\gamma_N$ such that
\[\tc_p(\gamma_n)\le \theta\eqlbl{eq:tcp}\]
for each $n$.

From \ref{eq:angle1} and \ref{eq:tcp},
it follows that for each $n$, there is $\alpha_n$ such that
\[\alpha_n-\theta
\le
\measuredangle(\dot\gamma_n(t),\bm{v}_\gamma)
\le
\alpha_n+\theta.\] 
The arc $\gamma_n$ with the maximal total curvature will solves the proposition.

It remains to choose $\delta$ so that $\theta(\delta)<\tfrac\eps{100}$.
\qeds


\parit{Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:almost-const}.}
Set $\gamma_0=\gamma$ and 
$\lambda_0=\tc\gamma_0$.

Fix $\delta>0$, set $n=\lceil\tfrac2\delta\rceil$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:eps-straight}, the geodesic $\gamma_0$ can be subdivided into $n$ arcs which are  $\delta$-straight.
Let us choose the arc $\gamma'_0$ with the maximal total curvature.
Assuming $\delta<\tfrac1{10}$ we get
\[\tc\gamma'_0\ge\tfrac\delta{10}\cdot\lambda_0.\]

Let $\alpha_1$ be the angle
and $\gamma_1$ be the arc in $\gamma'_0$ 
provided by Lemma~\ref{lem:almost-const}.
In particular 
\begin{align*}
\tc\gamma_1&\ge\delta\cdot\tc\gamma'_0
\ge
\\
&\ge \tfrac{\delta^2}{10}\cdot\lambda_0
\end{align*}


If 
$\alpha_1\le \tfrac\eps2$ or $\alpha_1\ge\pi-\tfrac\eps2$ 
and $\delta$ is small enough
then statement holds for the arc $\gamma_1$ and the vector $\bm{u}=\pm\bm{v}_{\gamma'_0}$.

Otherwise let us repeat the above construction for $\gamma_1$.
Namely, apply Lemma~\ref{lem:eps-straight} to the geodesic $\gamma_1$ and
denote by $\gamma_1'$ the $\delta$-straight 
arc with maximal total curvature.
If $\delta$ is small, we get 
\[
\tfrac\eps3
<
\measuredangle(\bm{v}_{\gamma_1'},\bm{v}_{\gamma'_0})
<
\pi-\tfrac\eps3
\eqlbl{eq:v1-perp-v_2}\]
Again, we get
\[\tc\gamma_1'\ge\tfrac\delta{10}\cdot\tc\gamma_1\ge \tfrac{\delta^3}{100}\cdot\lambda_0\]

Further apply Lemma~\ref{lem:almost-const} to $\gamma_1'$.
Denote by $\gamma_2$ and $\alpha_2$ the angle and the subarc of $\gamma_1'$.
Again
\[\tc\gamma_2\ge\tfrac{\delta^4}{100}\cdot\lambda_0\]


The curve $\gamma_2$ runs under nearly constant angle to  $\bm{v}_{\gamma'_0}$ and $\bm{v}_{\gamma'_1}$.
The inequality \ref{eq:v1-perp-v_2}
makes possible to apply Lemma \ref{lem:almost-const-angles}.
Hence the main statement in the proposition follows.

Straightforward computations prove the last statement.

\section{Elevating geodesics}\label{sec:elevating}

In this section we fix notations which will be used further 
without additional explanation.

Fix a $(x,y,z)$-coordinates on the Euclidean space;
denote by $(\bm{i},\bm{j},\bm{k})$
the standard basis.

The lines parallel to the $z$-axis will be called \emph{vertical};
the lines and planes parallel to $(x,y)$-plane will be called \emph{horizontal}.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
A smooth curve $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to\RR^3$ 
is called \emph{elevating} if both ends $\gamma(0)$ and $\gamma(\ell)$ lie on the $z$-axiz and 
$\measuredangle(\dot\gamma(t),\bm{k})<\tfrac1{10}$ for all $t$.
\end{thm}

\parbf{$\bm{(\lambda,\mu,\nu)}$-frame.}
Let $\Sigma$ be a convex surface 
and $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ is an elevating minimizing geodesic 
with unit-speed parametrization.

Given $t\in [0,\ell]$, 
consider the oriented orthonormal frame $\lambda(t),\mu(t),\nu(t)$ 
such that $\nu(t)$ is the outer normal to $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(t)$,
the vector $\mu(t)$ is horizontal and therefore the vector $\lambda(t)$ lies in the plane spanned by $\nu(t)$ and the $z$-axis.
We assume in addition that $\langle\lambda,\bm{k}\rangle\ge 0$.

Since $\langle\dot\gamma(t),\bm{k}\rangle>0$, 
$\nu(t)$ can not be vertical 
and therefore the frame $(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ is uniquely defined for any $t\in[0,\ell]$.

\parbf{Angle functions.}
Set 
\begin{align*}
\phi(t)&=\measuredangle(\bm{k},\dot\gamma(t)),&
\psi(t)&=\tfrac\pi2-\measuredangle(\bm{k},\nu(t)),&
\alpha(t)&=\tfrac\pi2-\measuredangle(\mu(t),\dot\gamma(t)),
\end{align*}

From the above definitions it follows that $|\alpha(t)|,|\psi(t)|\le \tfrac\pi2$ and for each $t$ there is a right spherical triangle with legs $|\alpha(t)|,|\psi(t)|$ and hypotenuse $\phi(t)$.
In particular $\cos\alpha\cdot\cos\psi=\cos\phi$.
Whence we get the following.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:alpha-phi-psi}
For any $t$ we have 
\[
\phi(t)\ge |\psi(t)|\ \ \text{and}\ \ \phi(t)\ge |\alpha(t)|
\]

\end{thm}

Applying Liberman's Lemma in the direction $\bm{k}$ we also get the following.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
If an arc $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ lies in the dark (light) side for $\bm{k}$ then 
the function $\phi$ is nondecreasing (correspondingly nonincreasing)
in $[a,b]$.
\end{thm}

\section{Plane sections}

Assume $\gamma$ is a curve on a smooth strictly convex surface $\Sigma$ in $\RR^3$.
Consider a plane $L$ 
passing through two points of $\gamma$, 
say $p=\gamma(a)$ and $q=\gamma(b)$ with $a<b$.
Let $L_\pm$ be a  half-planes in $L$ bounded by the line trough $p$ and $q$.
Set $\sigma_\pm=\Sigma\cap L_\pm$.

\begin{thm}{Observation}\label{obs:cut}
If $\gamma$ is a minimizing geodesic in the convex surface $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$ and $a$, $b$ and $\sigma_\pm$ as above then
\[\length\sigma_\pm\ge\length(\gamma|_{[a,b]}).\]
\end{thm}

To prove the observation, it is sufficient to note that $\sigma_\pm$ are a smooth convex plane curve connecting $p$ to $q$ in $\Sigma$.

Based on this observation we give couple of estimates on elevating minimizing geodesics.

Let $\gamma\:[a,b]\to\RR^3$ be a curve and $\ell$ be a line which does not pass through points of $\gamma$.
Assume $\phi\:[a,b]\to\RR$ be a continuous azimuth angle
of $\gamma$ in the cylindrical coordinates with the axis $\ell$.
If $\phi(b)-\phi(a)|\ge 2\cdot n\cdot\pi$,
we will say that $\gamma$ \emph{goes around} the line $\ell$
at least $n$ times.

\begin{thm}{Propostion}\label{prop:around-once}
Assume $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ is an elevating minimizing geodesic in the convex surface $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$.
Assume that for a subsegment $[a,b]\subset [0,\ell]$ the following conditions hold
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The points $\gamma(a)$ and $\gamma(b)$ lie in a half-plane with boundary line formed by the $z$-axis
and  the arc $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ goes around the $z$-axis at least once.
\item $\gamma(a)$ lies above the horizontal plane through $\tfrac12\cdot(\gamma(0)+\gamma(\ell))$.
\end{enumerate}
Then  $\gamma(b)$ lies on the dark side for $\bm{k}$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Let us apply Observation~\ref{obs:cut} to the plane containing $z$-axis, $\gamma(a)$ and $\gamma(b)$.


We can assume that $\gamma(0)$ is the origin of the $(x,y,z)$-coordinate system
and both points $p=\gamma(a)$ and $q=\gamma(b)$ lie in the $(x,z)$-coordinate half-plane with $x\ge 0$, denoted by $\Pi$.
We can assume that $\sigma_+\subset \Pi$.
Let $(x_p,0,z_p)$ and $(x_q,0,z_q)$ be the coordinates of $p$ and $q$.

From the assumptions we get $z_p<z_q<2\cdot z_p$.

Assume contrary,
then $\gamma(b)$ lies on the light side for $\bm{k}$.
Then from convexity of the curve $\Pi\cap \Sigma$
we get 
\[\length\sigma_+\le \sqrt{(z_q-z_p)^2+x_p^2}\]

On the other hand, since $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ goes around $z$-axis at least once,
we get 
\[\length\gamma|_{[a,b]}\ge \sqrt{(z_q-z_p)^2+(x_p+x_q)^2}.\]

These two estimates contradict Observation~\ref{obs:cut}.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:around-twice}
If $\Sigma$, $\gamma$, $\ell$, $a$ and $b$ as in the Proposition and the arc $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ goes around the $z$-axis at least twice
then the arc $\gamma|_{[b,\ell]}$ lies on the dark side with respect to $\bm{k}$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Fix $b'\in [b,\ell]$.
Note that one can find $a'\in [a,b]$ such that the the assumtions of Proposition~\ref{prop:around-once} hold for the interval $[a',b']$. Applying Proposition we get the result.\qeds 


\begin{thm}{Propostion}\label{prop:phi-psi}
Assume $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ is elevating minimizing geodesic in the convex surface $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$.
Assume that the arc $\gamma|_{[b,\ell]}$ lies in the dark side of $\Sigma$ with respect to $\bm{k}$.
If $b\le s<t\le \ell$ and the point $\gamma(s)$ lies in the plane $\Pi$ through $\gamma(t)$ spanned by $\nu(t)$ and $\lambda(t)$
then 
\[\phi(s)\le \psi(t).\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let us apply Observation~\ref{obs:cut} to the plane $\Pi$ and $p=\gamma(s)$ and $q=\gamma(t)$.

Let $z_p$ and $z_q$ be the $z$-coordinates of $p$ and $q$.

Since $\gamma|_{[s,t]}$ lies in the dark side,
its Liberman's development $\tilde\gamma|_{[s,t]}$ 
with respect to $\bm{k}$ is concave.
In particular 
\[\length(\gamma|_{[s,t]})
=
\length(\tilde\gamma|_{[s,t]})
\ge
\tfrac{z_q-z_p}{\cos\phi(s)}.\]

On the other hand, convexity of $\sigma_+$ imply that
\[\length\sigma_+\le \tfrac{z_q-z_p}{\cos\psi(t)}.\]
It remains to apply Observation~\ref{obs:cut}.
\qeds

\section{$s$-pairs}

Let $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$ 
be a strongly convex surface
and $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to\Sigma$ be an elevating minimizing geodesic.

After rotating $(x,y)$-plane if necessary, 
we can assume that the border of shadow in the directions of $x$-axis, say $\omega_x$, 
is a smooth curve and $\gamma$ intersects them transversely.

Let $t_1<t_2<\dots<t_k$ be the miting moments of $\gamma$ with $\omega_{\bm{i}}$
Set
\begin{align*}
\phi_n&=\phi(t_n)
&
\psi_n&=\psi(t_n)
&
\alpha_n&=\alpha(t_n).
\end{align*}
Note that the definition of $\alpha_n$ agrees with the one given in Section ???, so we can define $s_n$ as in Section ???.

We say that a pair of indexes $i<j$
forms an \emph{$\bm{s}$-pair} 
if 
\[
\sum_{n=i}^js_n=0\ \ 
\text{and}\ \ 
\sum_{n=i}^{j'}s_n>0
\]
if $i<j'<j$.

Note that for any index $i$ appears in at most one $\bm{s}$-pair and 
for any $\bm{s}$-pair $(i,j)$ we have
\begin{itemize}
\item $s_i=1$; that is, $i$-th braket has to be openning.
 \item $s_j=-1$; that is, $j$-th braket has to be closing.
\end{itemize}
In particular,
\[s_i\cdot\alpha_i+s_j\cdot\alpha_j=\alpha_i-\alpha_j.\]

\parbf{Bracket interpretation.}
If you exchange ``$+1$'' and ``$-1$'' in $\bm{s}$ by ``$($'' and ``$)$'' correspondingly then $(i,j)$ is an $\bm{s}$-pair
if and only if the $i$-th bracket forms a pair with $j$-bracket.

\parbf{Tongue interpretation.}
Assume $(i,j)$ is an $\bm{s}$-pair.
Note that in this case there is an arc of $\omega_{\bm{i}}$
from $\gamma(t_i)$ to $\gamma(t_j)$
with monotonic $z$-coordinate.
Moreover this arc, say $\sigma$ together with $\gamma|{[t_i,t_j]}$ bounds an immesed disc in $\Sigma$.
That is there is an immesion $\iota\:\DD\to\Sigma$ 
such that the closed curve $\iota|_{\partial \DD}$ is formed by joint of $\sigma$ and $\gamma|{[t_i,t_j]}$.

The proof can be guessed from the diagram.
It shows a lift of $\gamma$ in the universal cover of strip of $\Sigma$ between horizontal planes through $\gamma(t_i)$ and $\gamma(t_j)$;
the solid vertical lines correspond are lifts of $\sigma$ and the dashed lines corresponds to the lifts of the other component of $\omega_{\bm{i}}$ bethween the planes.

We say that $q$ is the depth of an $\bm{s}$-pair $(i,j)$
(briefly $q=\depth_{\bm{s}}(i,j)$) 
if $q$ is the maximal number such that theis $q$-long nested sequence of $\bm{s}$-pairs starting with $(i,j)$; 
that is a sequence of $\bm{s}$-pairs
$(i,j)=(i_1,j_1),(i_2,j_2),\dots,(i_q,j_q)$ such that
\[i=i_1<\dots<i_q<j_q<\dots<j_1=j.\]

We say that $q$ is the depth of an $\bm{s}$-pair $(i,j)$
(briefly $q=\depth_{\bm{s}}(i,j)$) 
if $q$ is the maximal number such that theis $q$-long nested sequence of $\bm{s}$-pairs starting with $(i,j)$; 
that is a sequence of $\bm{s}$-pairs
$(i,j)=(i_1,j_1),(i_2,j_2),\dots,(i_q,j_q)$ such that
\[i=i_1<\dots<i_q<j_q<\dots<j_1=j.\]

Note that the $\bm{s}$-pair of the same depth do not overlap;
that is if for two distinct $\bm{s}$-pairs $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$,
we have $\depth(i,j)=\depth(i',j')$
then either $i<j<i'<j'$ or $i'<j'<i<j$.

The following proposition follow directly from the definitions above.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:immersion}
Let $(i,j)$ be an $\bm{s}$-pair.
Then the arcs $\gamma|_{[t_i,t_j]}$ and an arc of $\omega_{\bm{i}}$ bound an immesed disc in $\Sigma$ which lies between horizontal planes through $\gamma(t_i)$ and $\gamma(t_j)$.
Moreover the maximal multiplicity of the disc is at most $\depth_{\bm{s}}(i,j)$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:Sq}
Let us denote by $S_q$  the subset of indiexes $\{1,\dots,k\}$
which are the parts of $\bm{s}$-pairs with depth $q$.
Then
\[\sum_{n\in S_q}s_n\cdot\alpha_n\le 4\cdot\pi\cdot q.\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} For each $n$ denote by $K_n$ the integral of Gauss curvature of the part of surface $\Sigma$ which lies below horizontal plane through $\gamma(t_n)$.
Note that 
\[0\le K_1\le\dots\le K_k\le 4\cdot\pi.\]


By Proposition~\ref{prop:immersion} and the Key Lemma,
we get
\[s_i\cdot\alpha_i+s_j\cdot\alpha_j=\alpha_i-\alpha_j\le q\cdot (K_j-K_i)\]

The statement follows since the $\bm{s}$-pairs with the same depth do not overlap.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:gamma-0}
Assume 
\[q=\max_{1\le i<j\le k}\left\{\left|\sum_{n=i}^js_n\right|\right\}\]
Then
\[\left|\sum_{n=1}^k (-1)^n\cdot\alpha_n\right|
\le 2\cdot q\cdot(q+\tfrac32)\cdot \pi.
\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $S$ the set of all indexes which appear in some $\bm{s}$-pair.

Note that depth of any $\bm{s}$ pair is at most $q$.
That is,
\[S=S_1\cup\dots\cup S_q.\]
By Corollary~\ref{cor:Sq},
\[\left|\sum_{n\in S}(-1)^n\cdot\alpha_n\right|\le 2\cdot q\cdot(q+1)\cdot\pi.\eqlbl{sum-S}\]

Set $R=\{1,\dots,k\}\backslash S$;
this is the set of indexes 
which do not appear in an $\bm{s}$-pair.

Given $r$, set $i\in Q_r$ 
if
\[\sum_{n=1}^is_n=r.\]
Note that $Q_r\ne\emptyset$ for at most $q$ values of $r$
and in each set $Q_r$ there are at most $2$ indexes 
which do not appear in an $\bm{s}$-pair;
that is $Q_r\cap R$ has at most two indexes for each $r$.

Sine $|a_n|<\tfrac\pi2$, we get
\[\left|\sum_{n\in R}s_n\cdot\alpha_n\right|
\le
q\cdot\pi.
\]
The later inequality together with \ref{sum-S} implies the statement in the corollary.

\section{Geometric growth}\label{sec:geometric-growth}

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:alpha-psi}
Assume $\psi(t)>\eps$ for and $t\in[t_{i},t_{j}]$
and $s_i+\dots+s_j=2$
Then 
\[|\alpha_j-\alpha_i|>\pi\cdot\sin\eps.\] 
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:geometric-grouth}
Let $\gamma$
be elevating minimizing geodesic on a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a concave function.
Then for any pair of indexes $j>i$,
such that 
\[|\sum_{n=i}^{j}s_n|> 5\]
we have
\[\phi_j>\tfrac32\cdot\phi_i.\]
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality, we may assume that 
\[\sum_{n=i}^{j}s_n= 6\]

Let $j'$ be the least index 
such that
\[|\sum_{n=i}^{j'} s_n|=5.\]

Note that for any $b>t_j$ there is $a\in[t_i,t_j]$
such that intrval $[a,b]$ satisfies the assumptions of Proposition~\ref{prop:phi-psi}.
In particular $\psi(b)>\phi_i$ for any $b>t_j$.
Applying Claim~\ref{clm:alpha-psi},
we get that $|\alpha_j|>\tfrac\pi2\cdot \phi_i$ or 
$|\alpha_{j'}|>\tfrac\pi2\cdot \phi_i$.
Since $\phi_n$ is nondecreasing,
and $\phi_n\ge |\alpha_n|$ for any $n$,
in both cases we get
\[\phi_j>\tfrac\pi2\cdot \phi_i.\]
Hence the result follows.
\qeds


\section{An estimate on dark side}\label{sec:graph}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:graph}
There is c constant $\omega'$ ($\omega'=10\cdot\pi$ will do)
such that
if $\gamma$ is an elevating minimizing geodesic on the dark side for $\bm{k}$ then
\[\tc_{\bm{i}}\gamma\le \omega'.\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We can assume that
$\gamma$ cross the $\bm{i}$-horizon $\omega_{\bm{i}}$ tranfersally.
Let $t_1<\dots<t_k$ be the meeting moments of $\gamma$ with $\omega_{\bm{i}}$ and
$s_1,\dots,s_k$ the signs.

Recall that $S_q$ denotes the subset of indexes $\{1,\dots,k\}$
which appear in $\bm{s}$-pair with depph $q$.
According to Corollary~\ref{cor:Sq},
\[\left|\sum_{n\in S_q}s_n\cdot\alpha_n\right|\le 4\cdot q\cdot \pi.\]
In particular,
\[\left|\sum_{n\in S_1\cup\dots\cup S_5}
s_n\cdot\alpha_n\right|
\le 
40\cdot\pi.\]

Set $R=\{1,\dots,k\}\backslash (S_1\cup\dots\cup S_5)$;
this is the set of indexes which appear in $\bm{s}$-pairs with depth at least $6$ 
as well as those which do not appear in any $\bm{s}$-pair.

According to Claim~\ref{clm:alpha-phi-psi},
\[\left|\sum_{n\in R}
(-1)^n\cdot\alpha_n\right|
\le
\sum_{n\in R}
|\alpha_n|\le \sum_{n\in R}\phi_n.\] 
To estimate the last sum will use the results in Section~\ref{sec:geometric-growth}.
First let us subdivide $R$ into 5 subsets $R_1,\dots,R_5$,
by setting 
$n\in R_m$ if $m\equiv n\pmod 5$.

Given $n\in R_m$, denote by $n'$ the least index in $R_m$ which is larger $n$;
$n'$ is defined for any $n\in R_m$ exept the largest one.
According to Claim~\ref{clm:geometric-grouth}, 
$\phi_{n'}>\tfrac32\cdot \phi_n$;
that is, the sequence $(\phi_n)_{n\in R_m}$ growes faster than the geometriac progression with coefficient $\tfrac32$.
Since $\phi_n$ is nondecreasing in $n$,
we get 
\[\sum_{n\in R_m}\phi_n< 3\cdot\phi_k.\]
It follows that 
\[\sum_{n\in R}\phi_n< 15\cdot\phi_k\le\tfrac{15}2\cdot\pi.\]

By Corollary~\ref{cor:liberman},
\begin{align*}
\tc_{\bm{i}}\gamma
&\le 
2\cdot\pi
+
2\cdot [\alpha_1-\alpha_2+\dots-(-1)^k\cdot\alpha_k]< 
\\
&< 100\cdot \pi.
\end{align*}
\qeds



\section{Final assembling of the proof}


Assume there is a minimizing geodesic $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ in a convex surface $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$ such that
\[\tc\gamma>\omega.\]

According to propositions \ref{prop:semicontinuity} and \ref{prop:convegence} we can assume that $\Sigma$ is closed and strongly convex
and the geodesic $\gamma$ has finite length.

According to Proposition~\ref{prop:almost-const}, 
we can pass to an $\tfrac1{10}$-elevating arc
of $\gamma$ for some $(x,y,z)$-coordinate system with total curvature $>\tfrac{\omega}{100^{100}}$%???NUMBER
.
Denote this arc by $\gamma'$;
we will use the notations in Section~\ref{sec:elevating} for $\gamma'$.

Rotating $(x,y)$-coordinate plane we can ensure that
\[\tc\gamma'\le 10\cdot\tc_{\bm{i}}\gamma'\]
and that $\gamma'$ cross the horizon $\omega_{\bm{i}}$ transversally.

By Corollary \ref{cor:around-twice},
we can subdivide $\gamma'$ into at most three arcs: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Lower arc} $\gamma_-'$ which lies on the light side for $\bm{k}$,
\item \emph{Middle arc} $\gamma_0'$ which rotatates around $z$-axis at most $4$ times.
\item \emph{Upper arc} $\gamma_+'$ which lies on the dark side for $\bm{k}$.
\end{itemize}

Indeed, choose an arc $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$  
above the horizonal line through $\tfrac12\cdot(\gamma(0)+\gamma(\ell))$ which rotates around $z$-axsis 2 times and $b$ takes the minimal possible value.  
Note that if $\gamma(s)$ lies on horizonal line through $\tfrac12\cdot(\gamma(0)+\gamma(\ell))$
then $[s,b]\supset[a,b]$ 
and any subarc of $[s,b]$ rotates around $z$ axis at most 2 times.

By Corollary \ref{cor:around-twice}, 
we can take $\gamma'_+=\gamma'|_{[b,\ell]}$;
in case if there is no such arc $[a,b]$, we assume that $\gamma_+'$ is not presented.
Repeat the construction referting the direction of $z$-axis;
we get the lower arc $\gamma_-'$.
The remaining arc is aaumed to be $\gamma_0'$; note that any subarc of $\gamma_0'$ is devided by the horizontal plane through $\tfrac12\cdot(\gamma'(0)+\gamma'(\ell))$ into two each of which rotate around $z$-axis at most 2 times. 
Therefore the number of rotations of any arc in $\gamma_0'$ is at most $4$.

Let us estimate the total curvature of $\gamma_-$, $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_+$ separately.

By Proposition~\ref{prop:graph}, we get 
\[\tc_{\bm{i}}\gamma_+\le 100\cdot\pi.\eqlbl{+}\]
Similarly  
\[\tc_{\bm{i}}\gamma_-\le 100\cdot\pi.\eqlbl{-}\]

By Corollary~\ref{cor:gamma-0},
\[\tc_{\bm{i}}\gamma_0\le 100\cdot\pi.\eqlbl{0}\]
Together with \ref{+}, \ref{-} and \ref{0}
the later implies that 
\[\tc_{\bm{i}}\gamma\le 300\cdot\pi.\]

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Given $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that the following condition holds.

Assume $\gamma$ is a smooth unit-speed curve 
in the unit ball $B\subset\RR^3$.
Assume 
$\length\gamma<\delta$ 
and $B$ contains an equilateral triangle with vertices $x_1,x_2,x_3$ with sides $\eps$
and for some fixed numbers
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3$
for any $i$
we have either
\[|\gamma(t)-x_i|\le \tfrac\eps{10}\ \ \text{or}\ \ \measuredangle(x_i-\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t))\lege \alpha_i\pm\delta\]
for any $t$.
Then there is a unit vector $u$ such that
\[\measuredangle(\dot\gamma(t),u)\le\tfrac\pi3\]

Moreover if $\eps=\tfrac1{100}$ 
then one can take $\delta=\tfrac1{10000}$.
\end{thm}

The proof is straightforward calculations
and it is left to the reader.

\parit{Proof.}
Applying rescaling, we can assume that $\diam\gamma=3$.
By Lemma \ref{lem:diam-length} $\length\gamma_n\zz<12$.
Therefore we can subdivide $\gamma$ into $12$ 
arcs $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_{12}$
such that for each $n$ there is a point $p_n\in K$ 
which lies on the distance at least $1$ from $\gamma_n$ and $\length\gamma_n\le 1$.
Choose
an arc $\gamma'=\gamma_n$ with the maximal total curvature 
and set $p'=p_n$.
Clearly
\[\tc\gamma'\ge\tfrac1{12}\cdot\tc\gamma.\]


Applying Liberman's Lemma to $\gamma'$ with  the reference point $p'$ 
we get that 
\[\tc\tilde\gamma'_{p'}<\pi+1<5.\]

Choose an integer $N>\tfrac2\eps$.
Note that we can divide $\gamma'$ into $N$ arcs 
$\gamma'_1,\dots,\gamma'_N$
so that 
\[\tc_{p'}\gamma_n'\le \tfrac{5}{N}\]
for each $n$.
Choose among these arcs the one with maximal total curvature,
denote it further by $\gamma''$.
Clearly 
\[\tc\gamma''>\tfrac\eps{10^3}\cdot \tc\gamma'.\]

Fix a parameter $t$ of $\gamma''$
and denote by $\alpha$ the angle between $\dot\gamma''(t)$ and $p-\gamma''(t)$.

If $\alpha<\tfrac\eps2$ or $\alpha>\pi-\tfrac\eps2$,
then the problem is solved.

Otherwise 
applying Lemma \ref{lem:eps-straight} we get a nondegenerate (say equilateral) 
triangle $\triangle a_1a_2a_3$ in $K_n$ 
of the size comparable to $\diam \gamma'$ 
and on the distance comparable to $\diam \gamma'$ from any point of $\gamma''$,
say side of triangle can be taken to be $\tfrac{\eps^2}{1000}\cdot\diam \bar\gamma$
and the distance to any point can be assumed to be between $\diam \bar\gamma$ and $2\cdot \diam \bar\gamma$

Apply the construction to each vertex of the triangle.
We pass to an arc of $\hat\gamma$
such that the angle between $\dot\gamma(t)$ and $a_i-\gamma(t)$ 
and the distance $|\gamma(t)-a_i|$
are nearly constant for each $i$.
The later imply that $\dot\gamma$ is nearly constant.

Denote by $\Sigma_t$ the subset of $\Sigma$ which lies below $\gamma(t)$;
that is
\[\Sigma_t=\set{x\in \Sigma}{\langle x-\gamma(t),\bm{k}\rangle\le 0}.\]
Denote by $K_t$ the integral of Gauss curvature along $\Sigma_t$.
Note that $t\mapsto K_t$ is nondecreasing.




Set $K_n=K_{t_n}$. Note that $0\le K_0\le \dots\le K_k\le 4\cdot \pi$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:s-pair}
Assume for some $(i,j)$ is an $\bm{s}$-pair.
Then
\[s_i\cdot\alpha_i+s_j\cdot\alpha_j\le (K_j-K_i)\cdot\depth_{\bm{s}}(i,j).\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Consider the closed curve formed by the arc $\gamma|_{[t_i,t_j]}$ and the arc of $\omega_{\bm{i}}$ from $\gamma(t_i)$ to $\gamma(t_j)$.
Note that it forms the boundary of immersed $\iota\:\DD\looparrowright\Sigma$ 
which lies between the horizontal planes through $\gamma(t_i)$ and $\gamma(t_j)$
and it overlaps at most $\depth_{\bm{s}}(i,j)$ times;
that is for any any $p\in\Sigma$ the set $\iota^{-1}(\{p\})$ contains at most $\depth_{\bm{s}}(i,j)$ points.

Applying Key lemma, the statement follows.
\qeds















Set $R=\{1,\dots,k\}\backslash (S_1\cup\dots\cup S_5)$;
this is the set of indexes which do not appear in any $\bm{s}$-pairs
as well as the indexes which appera in $\bm{s}$-pairs of depth at least $6$.

According to ???, the theorem will follow if we can find an universal upper bound on 
\[|\sum_{n\in R}s_n\cdot \alpha_n|.\]

Further let us subdivide $R$ into $R_1,\dots R_5$,
by setting 
\[R_r=\set{n\in R}{s_1+\dots+s_n\equiv r\pmod 5}.\]


Consider yet two more angle functions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\phi(t)=\measuredangle(\dot\gamma(t),\bm{k})$. Set $\phi_n=\phi(t_n)$.
\item Let $\psi(t)$ be the signed angle between $\nu(t)$ and $(x,y)$-plane. 
Set $\psi_n=\psi(t_n)$.
\end{itemize}
Note that 
\[\phi(t)\ge |\psi(t)|\ \ \text{and}\ \  \phi(t)\ge |\alpha(t)|\] 
for any $t$.
In particular 
\[\phi_n\ge |\psi_n|\ \ \text{and}\ \  \phi_n\ge |\alpha_n|\]
for any $n$.
It follows that
\[|\sum_{n\in R}s_n\cdot \alpha_n|\le \sum_{n\in R}\phi_n.\]
Given $n\in R_r$, denote by $n'$ the lest index in $R_r$ bigger than $n$.
Our aim is to show that $\phi_{n'}\ge 2\cdot\phi_n$.
In this case 

Since $\phi_n\le \pi$, we will get
\[\sum_{n\in R_r}\phi_n\le 2\cdot \pi.\]

\parbf{Horizontal rotation.}
Note that $\mu(t)$ is horizontal for any $t$.

Define the rotation $\rho[a,b]$  
of the interval $[a,b]\subset[0,\ell]$
as the
algebraic rotation of $\mu(t)$ around the origin in $(x,y)$-plane;
say it can be defined by the formula 
\[\rho_{[a,b]}
=
\int\limits_a^b \<\mu(t),\mathrm{J}(\dot\mu(t))\>\cdot dt,\]
where $\mathrm{J}\:\RR^2\to\RR^2$ denotes the rotation by angle $\tfrac\pi 2$ around the origin.

Note that 
\[\rho[t_i,t_{i+1}]=\tfrac\pi2\cdot(s_i+s_{i+1}).\]

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Assume that 
\[\gamma_z(t_i)\ge \tfrac12\cdot(\gamma_z(\ell)+\gamma_z(0))\ \ \text{and}\ \ \left|\sum_{n=i}^js_n\right|=6.\]
Then $\psi(t)>0$ for any $t\ge t_j$.
\end{thm}

Note that the claim implies that from $t_j$,
the geodesic $\gamma$ 
lies on a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a concave function $f\:\RR^2\to\RR$
and forms a minimizing geodesic in this graph.
Indeed fix $\eps>0$ such that $\psi(t)>\eps$
for any $t\ge t_j$.
Consider the set $W$ which lies under all the supporting planes 
such that its outer normal vector forms angle at most 
$\tfrac\pi2-\eps$ with the vertical direction.
Note that the set $W$ forms a subgraph $z\le f(x,y)$ 
of a  concave $(\mathop{\rm ctg} \eps)$-Lipschitz function $f\:\RR^2\to \RR$
and all the points of $\gamma$ lie the graph $z=f(x,y)$

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary, that is $\phi(t)\le 0$ for some $t\ge t_j$.
Let us draw the half-plane $\Pi_+$ through $\gamma(t)$ bounded by the $z$-axis.
Denote by $\Pi_-$ the opposite half-plane for $\Pi_+$ .

Note that there are two values $t_+<t_-$ in $[t_i,t_j]$
such that $\gamma(t_\pm)\in \Pi_\pm$.

Consider the sub-arc $\sigma$ 
of $\Sigma\cap\Pi$ from $\gamma(t)$
to $\gamma(t')$.
Since $\gamma$ is minimizing we have that 
\[\length \gamma|_{[t',t]}\le \length\sigma.\]

The later contradicts straightforward estimates.
Namely assume 
$a$ and $a_+$ be the distances from $\gamma(t)$ and $\gamma(t_+)$ to the $z$-axis.
Further set $b=\langle \gamma(t)-\gamma(0),\bm{k}\rangle$ 
and 
$b_+=\langle \gamma(t)-\gamma(0),\bm{k}\rangle$.
By the assumptions we have $b\le 2\cdot b_+$;
it follows that  $a_+\le a\le 2\cdot a_+$
and therefore 
\[(\length\sigma)^2\le (b-b_+)^2+a_+^2.\]
On the other hand, since $t_+<t_-<t$ we get that 
\[(\length\gamma|_{[t_+,t]})^2\ge (b-b_+)^2+(a+a_+)^2.\]
\qeds

Note that the last claim imply the following.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:graph}
Assume Main Theorem does not hold;
that is, there is a sequence of convex surfaces $\Sigma_n$
and a sequence of minimizing geodesic $\gamma_n$ in $\Sigma_n$ such that 
\[\tc \gamma_n\to\infty\ \ \text{as}\ \ n\to\infty.\]

Then we can make in addition one of the following assumtions:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item\label{graph} $\Sigma_n$ is a graph $z=f_n(x,y)$ of a smooth convex function $f_n\:\RR^2\to\RR$
and $\dot\gamma_z(t)>0$ for any $t\in[0,\ell]$. 
\item\label{finite} $\left|\sum_{n=i}^js_n\right|<10$ for any $i<j$.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{thm}

In particular, from now on $\psi(t)>0$ for any $t\in[0,\ell]$.
Note also that by Liberman's lemma $\phi(t)$ is a nondecreasing function on $[0,\ell]$.
The two cases (\ref{graph}) and (\ref{finite}) will be done separetely.
The case (\ref{graph}) is more involved.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Let $[a,b]\subset[0,\ell]$ and $\rho[a,b]\ge 3\cdot\pi$.
Then $\psi(t)\ge \phi(a)$ for any $t\ge b$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Claim}
Assume  
$\psi(t)\ge \eps>0$ for any $t\in [a,b]$.
Then 
$\alpha(b)-\alpha(a)>\eps\cdot\rho[a,b]$.
In particular, either $|\alpha(a)|>\tfrac12\cdot\eps\cdot\rho[a,b]$ or $|\alpha(b)|>\tfrac12\cdot\eps\cdot\rho[a,b]$.
\end{thm}

Note that above two claims imply the following.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Assume $\gamma$ as in Proposition \ref{prop:graph}
and for some $i<j$ we have
\[\left|\sum_{n=i}^js_i\right|=5\]
Then $\phi_j>2\cdot\phi_i$.
\end{thm}













We will assume that the lines parallel to $\bm{u}$ become vertical in the $(x,y)$-plane,
so that the development $\tilde\gamma$ is always a graph.
We say that development is convex (concave) on some arc if it is descrived by convex (correspondingly concave) function on this arc.


Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth strongly convex surface in $\RR^3$
and $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to\Sigma$ be a unit-speed geodesic.
Given a point $p\in\RR^3$, set $f_p(t)=|\gamma(t)-p|^2$
Then the following two expressions have the opposite  signs
\[f_p''(t)-2
\ \ \text{and}
\ \ \langle\nu_{\gamma(t)},\gamma(t)-p\rangle.
\]
In particular, if $p$ lies inside of $\Sigma$ then $f_p''(t)-2<0$ for any $t$.

Given a unit vector consider the function $h_{\bm{u}}=\langle\gamma(t),\bm{u}\rangle$.
Then the following two expressions have the opposite signs
\[h_{\bm{u}}''(t)
\ \ \text{and}
\ \ \langle\nu_{\gamma(t)},\bm{u}\rangle.
\]


Assume $\gamma$ is a geodesic on smooth convex surface $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$.

Let $\gamma$ be a curve and $\bm{u}$ is a unit vector in $\RR^3$.
Concider the cylindrical surface formed by all the lines parallel to $\bm{u}$ which pass through points of $\gamma$.
This surface is flat and it can be developed isometrically on the plane. 
The image 
of $\gamma$ is called Liberman's development of $\gamma$ in the direction of $\bm{u}$;
it will be denoted by $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}$.
(Formally, to perform this construction,
we have to assume that $\dot\gamma$ is not collinear with $\bm{u}$,
and the general case the construction is done by approximation.)


Let $\Sigma$ be convex surface and $p\in \Sigma$.
We say that $p$ lies on the \emph{dark} (\emph{light}) side of $\Sigma$ with respect to $\bm{u}$, if the points $p+t\cdot\bm{u}$ (correspondingly $p-t\cdot\bm{u}$) lie outside of $\Sigma$ for all $t>0$.
The intersection of dark and light side is called \emph{horizon} with respect to $\bm{u}$;
it will be denoted by $\omega_{\bm{u}}$.
If $\Sigma$ is strongly and smooth convex then $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ is a smooth curve.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Let $\gamma$ be a geodesic on a convex surface $\Sigma\subset\RR^3$ and $\bm{u}$ is a unit vector.
Then the arc $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}|_{[a,b]}$ of Liberman develpoment $\tilde\gamma_{\bm{u}}$
is convex (concave) if and only if the corresponding arc $\gamma|_{[a,b]}$ 
lies on the light (correspondingly dark) side of $\Sigma$ with respecto to $\bm{u}$.
\end{thm}

The proof of the estimate on the total curvature of geodesic on convex surface given by Liberman in \cite{liberman} is based on the observation that the total curvature of concave as well as convex graph
can not exceed $\pi$.


\parbf{Conical Liberman lemma.} Inseted of cylindrical surface,
one can consider the conical surface with given tip $z\notin \gamma$ trough $\gamma$.
The conical surface is flat and it can be developed isometrically on the plane
and the image of $\gamma$ is called \emph{Liberman's development} with repsct to point $z$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Assume the point $z$ lies inside the convex surface $\Sigma$.
Then Liberman development with respect to point $z$
of any geodesic $\gamma$ on $\Sigma$ is locally convex.
\end{thm}





A curve $\tilde\gamma$ in $(x,y)$-plane is called \emph{Librman's development} of $\gamma$ in the direction of $\bm{u}$
if there is a legth-preserving $\iota\:\RR^2\to\RR^3$
such that $\gamma=\iota\circ \tilde\gamma$ and $\iota$ is cylindrical in the direction of $\bm{u}$; the is
$\iota(x,y_1)-\iota(x,y_0)=(y_1-y_0)\cdot\bm{u}$
for any $x,y_0$ and $y_1$.

Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth convex hypersurface in the Euclidean space.

Given a point $p\in \Sigma$, we will denote by $n_p$ the outer normal vector of $\Sigma$ at $p$;
the map $\Sigma\to\SS^2$ defined as $p\mapsto n_p$ sometimes is called \emph{Gauss map}.

Given a unit vector $\bm{u}$,
we say that a point $p\in \Sigma$
lies on the \emph{dark} (\emph{light}) side of $\Sigma$ with respect to $\bm{u}$, if $\langle\bm{u},n_p\rangle\ge0$ (correspondingly $\langle\bm{u},n_p\rangle\le0$).
If $\langle\bm{u},n_p\rangle=0$, we say that $p$ lies on the \emph{horizon} with respect to $\bm{u}$.
The horizon with respect to $\bm{u}$ will be denoted by $\omega_{\bm{u}}$;
if $\Sigma$ is strongly convex then $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ is a smooth curve.

Fix a points $z\notin\Sigma$.
Given a point $p\in \Sigma$,
we say that $p$ lies on light (dark) side from $z$ if 
if $\langle z-p,n_p\rangle\le 0$ (correspondingly $\langle z-p,n_p\rangle\ge 0$).
If $\langle z-p,n_p\rangle= 0$ we say that $p$ lies on the horizon
from $p$.
Note that if $z$ lies inside of $\Sigma$ then all points on $\Sigma$ lie on the dark side from $z$.

Let $\gamma$ be a space curve 
parametrized by length.
Fix a point $z\notin\gamma$. 
Let us define \emph{Liberman's development} of $\gamma$ with respect to $z$ as the unit-speed plane cure $\tilde\gamma_z$ such that the direction $\tilde\gamma_z(t)$
changes counterclockwise as $t$ changes
and
$|\tilde\gamma_p(t)|=|\gamma(t)-z|$ for any $t$.

The Liberman's development $\tilde\gamma_z$ is called convex concave at $\tilde\gamma_z(t)$ if there the curvelinear triangle ??? 


Assume $\gamma$ is a smooth curve in $\RR^3$ and $\bm{u}$ is a unit vector.
Concider the cylindrical surface formed by all the lines parallel to $\bm{u}$ passing through the points on $\gamma$.


Let $\Sigma$ be a convex surface in the Euclidean space 
$z\not\in\Sigma$ and $\gamma$ be a unit-speed geodesic in $\Sigma$.
Then the development $\tilde\gamma_z$ is locally convex (concave) 
at the points on dark (light) side of $\Sigma$ with respect to $z$.


Assume $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ is a unit-speed curve in the space.

The vector $\ddot\gamma(t)$ is the curvature vector of $\gamma$ at $t$.
The total curvature of $\gamma$ can be defined as 
\[\tc\gamma\df\int\limits_0^\ell|\ddot\gamma(t)|\cdot dt.\]

The total curvature of $\tilde\gamma_z$ 
is called the total curvature of $\gamma$ in the direction of $z$ 
and denoted as $\tc_z\gamma$
Given a point $z$, let us define the total curvature of $\gamma$ in the direction of $z$ as
\[\tc_z\gamma
\ge
\int\limits_0^\ell
\left|
\langle\ddot\gamma(t),\tfrac{z-\gamma(t)}{|z-\gamma(t)|}\rangle
\right|
\cdot dt.\]
















Assume that one of the arcs of $\omega_{\bm{u}}$ from $\gamma(a)$ and $\gamma(b)$, 
say $\omega_{\bm{u}}^+$, together with $\gamma$ bound a disc in $\Sigma$.
In particular,
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}\gamma
\le
\int\limits_{\Omega} K\cdot d\area\]



\begin{thm}{Key Lemma}
\label{lem:key}
Let $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to \Sigma$ be a geodesic on the convex surface in the Euclidean space 
and $u\in\SS^2$.
Assume that $0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_n=\ell$ be the values such that each arcs $\gamma|_{[t_{i-1},t_i]}$ alternating light and dark side of $\Sigma$ with respect to $u$.
Set $\alpha_i=\measuredangle(\dot\gamma(t_i),u)$
Then 
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}\gamma=|\sum_i(-1)^i\alpha_i|.\]

Moreover, if $1<i<n$ 
and $\Omega_i$ denotes the domain of $\Sigma$ bounded by the arc $\gamma|_{[t_{i-1},t_i]}$ and the $u$-horizon then 
\[|\alpha_i-\alpha_{i-1}|\le \curv\Omega_i,\]
where $\curv\Omega_i$ denotes the total curvature of $\Omega_i$.
In particular,
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}\gamma\le 4\cdot\pi+\sum_i\curv\Omega_i.\]
\end{thm}

\parbf{Remarks.}
Clearly $\tc_z\gamma\le \tc \gamma$ for any curve $\gamma$ in $\Sigma$.

On the other hand given few points $z_i$ which do not lie in one plane
one can estimate $\tc\gamma$ 
in terms of $\tc_{z_i}\gamma$ 
the distances between $z_i$ and the maximal distance to $\gamma$.

Let $N=N(\Sigma,\gamma, u)$ be the maximal integer such that at most $N$ of the domains $\Omega_i$ intersect at one point.
Note that from \cite{BKZ}, it follows that the value $N$ can take arbitrary large value.
The number $N$ can be estimated through the maximal rotation number of subarcs of $\gamma$ with respect to the lines.
In particular the total curvature of geodesic $\gamma$ 
can be bounded in terms of maximal rotation number of subarcs of $\gamma$ around the lines.
The later was claimed in \cite{BKZ} without a proof.

Then
\[\sum_{i=2}^{n-1}\curv\Omega_i
\le 
N\cdot\curv\Sigma
\le 
4\cdot N\cdot\pi.\]
Therefore, we get an estimate
\[\tc_{\bm{u}}\gamma
\le 
4\cdot N\cdot\pi+|\alpha_0-\alpha_1|+|\alpha_{n-1}-\alpha_n|
\le
(4\cdot N+2)\cdot\pi.\]
Since the same holds for any vector $u$,
we can taking avarage we get
\[\tc\gamma\le 3\cdot(4\cdot N+2)\cdot\pi.\]
